    <!--Tyre descriptions-->
    <string name="winter_description">This car has winter tyres. Winter tires are designed to provide better traction, handling, and braking in cold weather, snow, and ice. They have a different tread pattern with more grooves and sipes (tiny slits) that bite into snow and ice, and a softer rubber compound that stays pliable in freezing temperatures. This enables them to grip the road better than summer or all-season tires, which become harder and lose traction in colder temperatures. Winter tires are typically marked with a mountain and snowflake symbol on the sidewall, indicating they meet industry standards for snow traction.</string>
    <string name="summer_description">This car has summer tyres. Summer tires are designed to provide maximum performance and handling in warm and dry conditions. They have a tread pattern that is optimized for dry and wet roads, with less emphasis on snow and ice traction. Summer tires typically have a harder rubber compound than all-season or winter tires, which allows them to maintain their grip and shape at higher temperatures. They also have wider grooves to help channel water away from the tire, which reduces the risk of hydroplaning. Summer tires are ideal for high-performance vehicles and driving enthusiasts who demand the best possible handling and cornering performance in warm weather.</string>
    <string name="season_description">This car has all-season tyres. All-season tires are designed to provide reliable handling and performance in a wide range of weather conditions, including dry, wet, and light snow. They are typically made with a tread pattern and rubber compound that is optimized for both warm and cold weather, allowing them to provide good traction and grip on a variety of surfaces. All-season tires are a popular choice for drivers who want a single set of tires that can be used year-round, without the need for separate winter tires. However, it\'s important to note that all-season tires may not perform as well in extreme winter conditions as dedicated winter tires.</string>
    <string name="slicks_description">This car has slick tyres. Slick tyres are a type of racing tyre that has no tread pattern, providing maximum contact with the road. They are designed to give race cars better grip and handling on smooth, dry tracks. Slick tyres are made from a softer compound than regular tyres, allowing them to heat up more quickly and provide better traction. They also have a larger contact patch, which means more rubber is in contact with the road, resulting in more grip. Slick tyres are used in a variety of racing categories, including Formula 1, IndyCar, and sports car racing.</string>
